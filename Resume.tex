\section*{PROJECTS}

\subsection*{Demeter AI}
This is my upcoming submission to the GenAI hackathon run by the D\(^3\) Institute from Harvard hosted at Microsoft HQ. The purpose of this project is to process DNA primer strips to recognize and taxonomically classify organisms providing farmers with comprehensive treatments which not only would improve the farmers crop yield but have huge spillover effects into daily life and society.

\subsection*{Cat Smasher}
Embark on a whimsical gaming adventure with our retro-inspired Pong rendition. Picture this: one player, armed with a motion controller, engages in a lively duel against an unbeatable AI opponent. The twist? Instead of the conventional ball, players find themselves gleefully bashing a cat around the screen. The atmosphere is set with unbelievably cheery music, creating a blend of classic gameplay, motion control antics, and humor. Get ready for a gaming experience that's not only entertaining but also delightfully quirky! ðŸ¥‡ - Halton Hacks Best Rookie Hack

\subsection*{RedLeaf Finance}
RedLeaf Finance was the finance app I created when I was just ten years old. It enabled users to buy, sell, obtain quoted prices, check their holdings, and view their losses and profits. While it may not be the most impressive project I've ever undertaken, I decided to include it on the list due to the sheer personal pride I felt upon its completion. This project holds special significance for me as it played a pivotal role in sparking my passion for programming and ultimately led me to be who I am today.
